            You're a common street pigeon just minding your own business and
            lifing a regular pigeon life. Until one day you open the newspaper
            and read the following article:<span class="bold-text-blue"
              ><br />"The symbol of the dove of peace has <u>no</u> behavioural
              equivalent in the street pigeon."<br /></span
            >Your shocked, but keep reading:<br /><span class="bold-text-blue"
              >"Street pigeons are estimated to be involved in 2000 fights a
              year. Therefore, they have absolutely nothing in common with the
              peaceful peace pigeon. I repeat. Absolutely nothing!"</span
            ><br />
            Enraged, you throw the newspaper into the corner and swear to
            yourself:
            <br /><span class="bold-text-black">
              "I will prove to the world that I can go a year without a
              fight!"</span
            >
          </p>
          <h3><u>Avoid all other pigeons to not get into a fight for 365 days. Use the arrow keys "up" and "down".</u></h3>

          After you survived the last day of the year without a fight, you glide
          to the ground, exhausted but happy. In the landing approach, your last
          forces dwindle and your eyes go black. <span><br /></span> Suddenly
          you see a small light at the end of the horizon. It comes closer to
          you until it finally envelops you completely and a loud voice
          booms:<span><br /></span>
          <span class="bold-text-white"
            >"You have proven yourself worthy! From now on you shall live as a
            symbol of peace in paradise among your equals."<br /></span
          >With newfound strength you see that your once so dirty gray plumage
          shines in glistening white and you think to yourself:<span
            class="bold-text-white"
            ><br />"I am Pigeon the White!"</span
