              <p>
                You're a street pigeon just minding your own business until one day you open the newspaper and read the following:
                <br/>
                <br/>
                 "The symbol of the dove of peace has nothing in common with a street pigeon, as it is estimated that street pigeons are involved in up to 2000 fights a year."
                  <br/>
                  <br/>
                Enraged, you throw the newspaper into the corner and swear to
                yourself:
                <br/>
                  <b>"I will prove to the world that I can go a year without a
                  fight!</b>
              </p>
            </div>
          </div>
          <div class="card">
            <img id="instructions-buttons-image" src="./images/arrowUpDown.png" />
            <div class="text-instruction-container">
              <h2>How to Play</h2>
              <br/>
              <p>
                Use the arrow keys "up" and "down" to avoid other pigeons.
                <br/>
                <br/>
                Don't get into a fight for 365 days. 
                <br/>
                <br/>
                The other pigeons will increase in speed.
                <br/>
                <br/>
                "Your Level" increases each time you have avoided 10 fights.
                <br/>
                <br/>
                Your movement speed will increase with each Level Up.

          After you survived the last day of the year without a fight, you glide
          to the ground, exhausted but happy. In the landing approach, your last
          forces dwindle and your eyes go black. <span><br /></span> Suddenly
          you see a small light at the end of the horizon. It comes closer to
          you until it finally envelops you completely and a loud voice
          booms:<span><br /></span>
          <span class="bold-text-white"
            >"You have proven yourself worthy! From now on you shall live as a
            symbol of peace in paradise among your equals."<br /></span
          >With newfound strength you see that your once so dirty gray plumage
          shines in glistening white and you think to yourself:<span
            class="bold-text-white"
