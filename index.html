          You're a common street pigeon just minding your own business and
          lifing a regular pigeon life. Until one day you open the newspaper and
          read the following article:<span class="bold-text-red"
            ><br />"The symbol of the dove of peace has <u>no</u> behavioural
            equivalent in the street pigeon."</span
          >Your shocked, but keep reading:<span class="bold-text-red"
            >"The male representatives of the street pigeon are estimated to be
            involved in 2000 fights a year. Therefore, they have absolutely
            nothing in common with the peaceful peace pigeon. Absolutely
            nothing!"</span
          ><br />
          Enraged, you throw the newspaper into the corner and swear to
          yourself:
          <span class="bold-text-black"
            >"This is outrageous - I will prove to the world that I can go 365
            days a year without a fight!"</span
          >
          <br />
          <br />
          Avoid all other pigeons to not get into a fight for one year . Good
          luck - you will need it.

          After you survived the last day of the year without a fight, you glide
          to the ground, exhausted but happy. In the landing approach, your last
          forces dwindle and your eyes go black. <span><br /></span> Suddenly
          you see a small light at the end of the horizon. It comes closer to
          you until it finally envelops you completely and a loud voice
          booms:<span><br /></span>
          <span class="bold-text-white"
            >"You have proven yourself worthy! From now on you shall live as a
            symbol of peace in paradise among your equals."<br /></span
          >With newfound strength you see that your once so dirty gray plumage
          shines in glistening white and you think to yourself:<span
            class="bold-text-white"
            ><br />"I am Pigeon the White!"</span
